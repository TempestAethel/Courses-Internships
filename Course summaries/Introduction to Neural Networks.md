# Introduction to Neural Networks: Course Overview

This course provides a comprehensive understanding of Neural Networks (NN), their functioning, types, applications, and use cases. It covers a range of essential topics, from the basics of neural networks to advanced concepts like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Hereâ€™s a brief summary of each lesson:

---

## Lesson 01: What is A Neural Network?

### Overview
A Neural Network (NN) is a computational model inspired by the way the human brain processes information. It consists of layers of nodes (neurons) that are interconnected, enabling the system to learn from data. NNs are primarily used for tasks such as classification, regression, and pattern recognition.

### Key Points:
- Nodes (neurons) are organized in layers: input, hidden, and output.
- The model learns by adjusting weights and biases during training.
- It mimics the brain's structure but in a much simpler form.

## Lesson 02: How Does The Neural Network Work?

### Overview
Neural Networks work through the process of forward propagation, where data is passed through each layer of neurons. The network learns by adjusting the weights of connections between neurons based on the error in predictions.

### Key Points:
- Input data is processed through neurons.
- Each layer performs transformations on the data.
- The output layer produces predictions.
- The error is backpropagated to adjust weights during training.

Different types of Neural Networks are designed to solve specific problems. Each architecture has its strengths and is suited for particular types of data and tasks.

### Key Points:
- **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)**: The simplest form, data flows in one direction.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Specialized for image processing.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: Best for sequential data like time series or text.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)**: Used for generating new data, e.g., images.

### Key Points:
- **Backpropagation**: The method of adjusting weights through the calculation of gradients.
- **Gradient Descent**: The optimization method used to minimize the error in the network by updating weights iteratively.

### Key Points:
- Data collection and preprocessing (resizing, normalization).
- Building a CNN model.
- Training and evaluating the model.
- Fine-tuning for better performance.

## Lesson 09: Introduction to Recurrent Neural Network

### Overview
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed for sequential data. Unlike traditional feedforward networks, RNNs have feedback loops that allow information to persist over time, making them ideal for tasks like time-series forecasting, speech recognition, and language modeling.

### Key Points:
- **Hidden State**: Captures past information from sequences.
- **Applications**: Time-series prediction, language modeling, and sentiment analysis.

## Lesson 10: Vanishing and Exploding Gradient Problem

### Overview
The vanishing and exploding gradient problems occur during backpropagation in deep networks, where gradients become too small (vanishing) or too large (exploding), making learning unstable.

### Key Points:
- **Vanishing Gradients**: Gradients become so small that weights stop updating.
- **Exploding Gradients**: Gradients become so large that weights update too drastically.
- **Solutions**: Use of techniques like gradient clipping and proper weight initialization.

## Lesson 11: Long Short Term Memory

### Overview
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of RNN designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem by maintaining a more stable learning process over long sequences of data.

### Key Points:
- **Cell State**: Remembers long-term information.
- **Gates**: Control the flow of information (input, forget, and output gates).
- **Applications**: Speech recognition, language translation, and more.

## Lesson 12: Use Case Implementation of LSTM

### Overview
This lesson explores a practical implementation of an LSTM for a sequence-based problem, such as predicting stock prices or generating text.

### Key Points:
- Data preparation for sequence prediction.
- Building and training an LSTM model.
