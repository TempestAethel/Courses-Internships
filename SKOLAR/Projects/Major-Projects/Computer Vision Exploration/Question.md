# Objective:
Explore various aspects of computer vision and apply your knowledge to solve real-world image-related tasks

# Instructions:
## Part 1: 

Understanding Computer Vision Basics
Watch the "Computer Vision Applications" video and review the reference material provided. Write a summary of the video's key points and discuss at least three real-world applications of computer visio
In the "Basics of Image Processing" section, perform the following tasks:
Choose an image of your choice and apply basic image processing techniques such as resizing, croppin and grayscale conversion.
Provide both the original and processed images, along with a short explanation of the transformations applied.
Explore the "Image Filtering and Enhancement" topic. Select an image with varying levels of noise and apply image filtering techniques to enhance its quality. Describe the filtering methods used and the impact on the image.


## Part 2: 

Image Classification and Deep Learning
After watching the "Image Classification" video and reviewing the reference material, select a dataset from a reliable source (e.g., Kaggle) that contains images of different classes (e.g., animals, vehicles, o objects). Perform image classification using a pre-trained deep learning model (e.g., VGG or ResNet). Report the model's accuracy and discuss its performance.
Dive into the "CNN in Computer Vision" and "Transfer Learning in Computer Vision" sections. Fine-tur pre-trained CNN model for a specific image classification task relevant to your dataset. Provide details the model architecture and training process.


## Part 3: 

Feature Detection and Object Detection
Explore the "Feature Detection and Matching" section. Implement a feature detection algorithm (e.g. Harris corners) on an image of your choice. Highlight the detected features and discuss their significar
Watch the "Object Detection" video and delve into the "Object Localization" topic. Apply an object detection model (e.g., YOLO or Faster R-CNN) to localize and label objects in an image. Present the res visually with bounding boxes and labels.


## Part 4: 

Image Segmentation and Object Tracking
Study the "Image Segmentation" section and perform image segmentation on a complex image containing multiple objects. Use an appropriate segmentation algorithm and visualize the segmented regions.
In the "Object Tracking" part, select a video containing moving objects (e.g., a sports game or traffic footage). Implement an object tracking algorithm (e.g., Mean-Shift or KLT tracker) to track a specific object throughout the video. Showcase the tracking results.
