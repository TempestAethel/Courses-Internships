Overview of the Titanic Dataset
The Titanic dataset consists of 891 samples and 12 features. 
Here is a brief description of each feature:
PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger
Survived: Survival indicator (0 = No, 1 = Yes) - Target variable
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Passenger's name
Sex: Passenger's gender
Age: Passenger's age
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
```
```
*Initial Observations
  Numerical Features: PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare
  Categorical Features: Name, Sex, Ticket, Cabin, Embarked
*Missing Values
  Age: 177 missing values
  Cabin: 687 missing values
  Embarked: 2 missing values
*Challenges
  Missing Values: A significant portion of the data is missing for the 'Age' and 'Cabin' columns.
  Categorical Data: Features like 'Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin', and 'Embarked' need to be processed and encoded appropriately for machine learning algorithms.
  Imbalanced Target Variable: It's essential to check if the target variable (Survived) is imbalanced, which can affect model performance.
```

# Data Preprocessing:
a. Data Cleaning: Identify and handle any missing values in the dataset. Explain your approach and the techniques you used for dealing with missing data. 
b. Feature Scaling: Apply appropriate feature scaling techniques (e.g., Standardization or Min-Max scaling) to normalize the numerical features in the dataset. 
c. Handling Categorical Data: Encode categoricalvariables using suitable techniques such as One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding. Explain the rationale behind your choice.

- a. Data Cleaning
    Age: The 'Age' column has 177 missing values.\
      Approach: We'll fill the missing 'Age' values with the median age of the passengers. This is a common technique as it reduces the impact of outliers and doesn't skew the distribution.\
    Cabin: The 'Cabin' column has 687 missing values.\
      Approach: Since the majority of the 'Cabin' values are missing, we'll drop this column from the dataset. \
    Embarked: The 'Embarked' column has 2 missing values.\
      Approach: We'll fill the missing 'Embarked' values with the mode (most frequent value), which is 'S' (Southampton).

- b. Feature Scaling
    Approach: We'll use Standardization (z-score normalization) to scale the numerical features. This method scales the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.This is particularly useful when the features have different units or scales.

- c. Handling Categorical Data
    Approach: We'll use One-Hot Encoding for the categorical features 'Sex' and 'Embarked'.One-Hot Encoding creates binary columns for each category, which is suitable for categorical variables without ordinal relationships.


# Feature Engineering:
Apply at least two feature engineering techniques to create new meaningful features from the existing ones.Explain why you selected these techniques and how they enhance the dataset's representational power.
Appling two feature engineering techniques to create new meaningful features from the existing ones. 
- Create the following new features:
    FamilySize: Combining the 'SibSp' and 'Parch' features to create a new feature representing the total number of family members aboard.
            This can provide insight into whether traveling with family had an impact on survival.
    Title: Extracting titles from the 'Name' feature (e.g., Mr., Mrs., Miss, etc.). 
            Titles can capture social status and potentially affect the likelihood of survival.
- Code examples to be used :
1. Create the FamilySize Feature
```
  # Create a new feature 'FamilySize' by combining 'SibSp' and 'Parch'
  df['FamilySize'] = df['SibSp'] + df['Parch'] + 1  # +1 to include the passenger themselves

  # Drop the 'SibSp' and 'Parch' columns as they are now represented by 'FamilySize'
  df.drop(columns=['SibSp', 'Parch'], inplace=True)

  df.head()
```
2. Extract the Title from the Name Feature
  ```
# Extract titles from the 'Name' feature
  df['Title'] = df['Name'].str.extract(' ([A-Za-z]+)\.', expand=False)

  # Simplify the titles into common groups
  df['Title'] = df['Title'].replace(['Lady', 'Countess', 'Capt', 'Col', 'Don', 'Dr', 'Major', 'Rev', 'Sir', 'Jonkheer', 'Dona'], 'Rare')
  df['Title'] = df['Title'].replace('Mlle', 'Miss')
  df['Title'] = df['Title'].replace('Ms', 'Miss')
  df['Title'] = df['Title'].replace('Mme', 'Mrs')

  # Drop the 'Name' column as it's no longer needed
  df.drop(columns=['Name'], inplace=True)

  df.head()

# Handling Imbalanced Data: 
If your dataset has imbalanced classes (e.g., in classification tasks),address this issue using a technique of your choice (e.g., oversampling, undersampling, SMOTE, or any other method).Provide details on how you handled class imbalance.\
Data Transformation:After completing data preprocessing and feature engineering,save the preprocessed dataset as a CSV file for further analysis. Include a link or attachment to this CSV file in your assignment submission.

- Handling Imbalanced Data:\
The Titanic dataset has an imbalanced class distribution in the 'Survived' column. \
To address this issue ,we use the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). \
SMOTE creates synthetic samples of the minority class to balance the dataset.\
Steps to Handle Class Imbalance with SMOTE
Identify Class Imbalance: Check the distribution of the target variable ('Survived').\
Apply SMOTE: Use SMOTE to generate synthetic samples for the minority class.\
Data Transformation and Saving the Preprocessed Dataset\
So We integrate SMOTE into our preprocessing pipeline and then save the final processed dataset as a CSV file.\
to implement:
1. Identify Class Imbalance :First, We check the class distribution of the 'Survived' column.
2. Apply SMOTE : We will use the SMOTE class from the imblearn library to balance the classes.
```
Implementation:
Here is the complete implementation, including SMOTE, feature engineering, and data preprocessing:
  import pandas as pd
  from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
  from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
  from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
  from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

  # Load the dataset
  file_path = 'path_to_your_file/train.csv'
  df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

  # Data Cleaning
  df['Age'].fillna(df['Age'].median(), inplace=True)
  df.drop(columns=['Cabin'], inplace=True)
  df['Embarked'].fillna(df['Embarked'].mode()[0], inplace=True)

  # Feature Engineering
  df['FamilySize'] = df['SibSp'] + df['Parch'] + 1
  df.drop(columns=['SibSp', 'Parch'], inplace=True)
  df['Title'] = df['Name'].str.extract(' ([A-Za-z]+)\.', expand=False)
  df['Title'] = df['Title'].replace(['Lady', 'Countess', 'Capt', 'Col', 'Don', 'Dr', 'Major', 'Rev', 'Sir', 'Jonkheer', 'Dona'], 'Rare')
  df['Title'] = df['Title'].replace('Mlle', 'Miss')
  df['Title'] = df['Title'].replace('Ms', 'Miss')
  df['Title'] = df['Title'].replace('Mme', 'Mrs')
  df.drop(columns=['Name'], inplace=True)
  
  # Feature Scaling and Encoding
  numerical_features = ['Age', 'Fare', 'FamilySize']
  categorical_features = ['Sex', 'Embarked', 'Title']

  preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
      transformers=[
          ('num', StandardScaler(), numerical_features),
          ('cat', OneHotEncoder(), categorical_features)
      ])
  
  # Prepare the features and target variable
  X = df.drop(columns=['Survived', 'PassengerId'])
  y = df['Survived']
  
  # Apply the transformations
  X_processed = preprocessor.fit_transform(X)
  
  # Apply SMOTE to balance the classes
  smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
  X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_processed, y)
  
  # Convert the resampled data back into a DataFrame
  numerical_cols = preprocessor.transformers_[0][2]
  categorical_cols = preprocessor.transformers_[1][1].get_feature_names_out(categorical_features)
  all_cols = list(numerical_cols) + list(categorical_cols)

  df_resampled = pd.DataFrame(X_resampled, columns=all_cols)
  df_resampled['Survived'] = y_resampled.reset_index(drop=True)

  # Save the processed dataset to a CSV file
  processed_file_path = '/mnt/data/processed_titanic_dataset.csv'
  df_resampled.to_csv(processed_file_path, index=False)

This code will balance the classes using SMOTE and save the processed dataset to a CSV file. 
If you run this code in your local Python environment, it will generate the processed dataset.
```

# Analysis:
Provide visualizations and summary statistics to illustrate the impact of data preprocessing and feature engineering on the dataset.Discuss how these techniques improved the dataset's suitability for machine learning tasks.\
To analyze the impact of data preprocessing and feature engineering on the Titanic dataset, we'll follow these steps:\
  1)Visualize the original class distribution to highlight the class imbalance.\
  2)Apply SMOTE to balance the classes.\
  3)Visualize the new class distribution after applying SMOTE.\

  sns.countplot(data=df, x='Title')
  plt.title('Distribution of Title Feature')
  plt.xlabel('Title')
  plt.ylabel('Count')
  plt.show()
  ```




# Conclusion:
Summarize the key takeaways from this assignment, including the importance of data preprocessing and feature engineering in preparing data for machine learning models.

- Key Takeaways :
  
1)Importance of Data Preprocessing:
  Handling Missing Values: Imputing missing values ensures the dataset is complete and usable. Using the median for numerical features and the mode for categorical features is a simple yet effective strategy to fill missing values without introducing bias.
  Dropping Irrelevant Features: Removing columns with too many missing values (e.g., 'Cabin') or irrelevant information (e.g., 'Name') simplifies the dataset and improves model performance by reducing noise.

2)Feature Scaling:
  Standardization: Scaling numerical features to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one ensures that all features contribute equally to the model, preventing features with larger scales from dominating.

3)Handling Categorical Data:
  One-Hot Encoding: Converting categorical variables into binary columns enables machine learning algorithms to interpret and leverage these features effectively.

4)Feature Engineering:
  Creating New Features: Deriving new features from existing ones, such as 'FamilySize' and 'Title', can provide additional context and relationships that enhance the model's ability to learn and make accurate predictions.
  Capturing Social Status and Family Context: Features like 'Title' capture social status, while 'FamilySize' captures family context, both of which can be critical factors in survival scenarios like the Titanic disaster.

5)Handling Imbalanced Data:
  SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique): Addressing class imbalance ensures that the model is trained on a balanced dataset, preventing bias towards the majority class and improving the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

# Summary of the Dataset Preparation Process
* Initial Dataset: The Titanic dataset contained various numerical and categorical features with some missing values and class imbalance in the target variable ('Survived').
* Data Cleaning: Filled missing values, dropped irrelevant columns, and ensured the dataset was complete and ready for further processing.
* Feature Scaling: Standardized numerical features to ensure equal contribution to the model.
* Handling Categorical Data: Applied one-hot encoding to convert categorical features into a machine-readable format.
* Feature Engineering: Created new features 'FamilySize' and 'Title' to provide additional context and improve the dataset's representational power.
* Handling Imbalanced Data: Applied SMOTE to balance the classes, ensuring the model can learn effectively from both classes.

# Importance of Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Data preprocessing and feature engineering are critical steps in preparing data for machine learning models. 
- Enhance Data Quality: Clean and complete data is essential for accurate model training.
- Improve Model Performance: Scaling features, encoding categorical variables, and creating meaningful features provide the model with the necessary information to make accurate predictions.
- Ensure Model Fairness: Handling class imbalance ensures the model is not biased towards the majority class, resulting in fairer and more reliable predictions.

Overall, these steps transform raw data into a structured and informative dataset that machine learning algorithms can effectively learn from, leading to better model performance and more accurate predictions.
