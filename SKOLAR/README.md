# Machine Learning Fundamentals

**Overview:** Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make predictions based on data. Unlike traditional programming, where explicit instructions are provided, machine learning algorithms improve their performance by learning from patterns in the data.

## Types of Learning:

- **Common Algorithms:**
  - **Linear Regression:** Used for predicting continuous outcomes. It establishes a relationship between independent variables and a dependent variable.
  - **Logistic Regression:** Used for binary classification tasks, providing probabilities for class membership.
  - **Decision Trees:** Hierarchical models that split data into branches based on feature values.
- **Applications:** Email spam detection, disease prediction, and customer churn analysis.

### Unsupervised Learning:

- **Definition:** The algorithm learns from unlabeled data, discovering hidden patterns or intrinsic structures.
- **Common Algorithms:**
  - **K-Means Clustering:** Groups data into K clusters based on feature similarity.
  - **Hierarchical Clustering:** Builds a tree of clusters based on distance metrics.

# Key Algorithms in Machine Learning

## Linear Regression:

- **Equation:** 
  \[
  Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + ... + \beta_n X_n
  \]
- **Objective:** Minimize the difference between predicted values and actual values using the least squares method.
- **Assumptions:** Linear relationship, independence of errors, homoscedasticity, and normality of errors.

## Logistic Regression:

- **Equation:** 
  \[
  P(Y=1 | X) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + ... + \beta_n X_n)}}
  \]
- **Objective:** Estimate the probability of a binary outcome, with outputs between 0 and 1.
- **Applications:** Disease presence prediction, customer segmentation, and marketing responses.

## Decision Trees:

- **Construction:** Recursive partitioning of the data based on feature values, selecting splits that maximize information gain or minimize impurity.
- **Pros and Cons:**
  - **Pros:** Easy to interpret, requires little data preprocessing.
  - **Cons:** Prone to overfitting, especially with complex trees.

## Support Vector Machines (SVM):

- **Concept:** Find the optimal hyperplane that separates classes with the maximum margin.
- **Kernel Trick:** Enables SVM to perform well in high-dimensional spaces by transforming input data into higher dimensions.
- **Applications:** Text classification, image classification, and bioinformatics.

## Neural Networks:

- **Structure:** Composed of input, hidden, and output layers, where each neuron receives inputs, processes them, and passes the output to the next layer.
- **Training:** Uses backpropagation to minimize the error by adjusting weights based on the gradient of the loss function.
- **Deep Learning:** Involves using neural networks with many hidden layers to capture complex patterns.

## Ensemble Methods:

- **Definition:** Techniques that combine predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy and robustness.
- **Common Techniques:**
  - **Bagging (e.g., Random Forest):** Builds multiple models on different subsets of data and averages their predictions.
  - **Boosting (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting):** Sequentially trains models, focusing on correcting the errors made by previous models.

# Model Evaluation and Selection

## Importance of Evaluation:
Proper model evaluation ensures that the model performs well not only on the training data but also on unseen data, which is crucial for real-world applications.

## Common Metrics:

- **Accuracy:** The proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined.
- **Precision:** The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. High precision indicates a low false positive rate.
- **Recall (Sensitivity):** The ratio of true positives to the actual positives. High recall indicates the model can capture most of the positive cases.
- **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
- **ROC Curve and AUC:** The Receiver Operating Characteristic curve plots true positive rates against false positive rates, with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) providing a single metric for model performance.

## Cross-Validation:

- **k-Fold Cross-Validation:** The dataset is split into k subsets, and the model is trained k times, each time using a different subset for validation and the remaining for training. This approach helps in assessing model performance more reliably and reduces overfitting.
